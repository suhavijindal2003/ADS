    //Tree intro
    //A tree is a hieraraical data strusture  consisteing of nodes
    //witha root node at the top and child node at below it
    //Trees are widely used in apllication such as databases etc

    //TYPES OF TREE
    //Binary tree:each node has at mpost two childens(right and left)
    //Binary seacrch tree
    // A binary tree where:
    //left child<parent
    //right child>parents

    //balanced tre: AVL tress,red black tree etc
    //heap
    //trie: etc

    //leetcode 102
    //given a binary stree ,return the level order traversal of the nodes value


    //APPROACH: FIFO(): we have to use Queue for BFS traversal
    //
